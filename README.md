<h1>Hi, I'm Aset!<br/></h1>

<h2>🙂 About Me</h2>
I am Aset, an 18 year old IT enthusiast! When I was 16, I was first introduced to IT because I heard it was a well paying job. At first, I only studied for it for the good pay. After spending some time learning IT, I developed a passion for it. Now it is my dream to pursue an IT career, and I hope to benefit the world with my expertise!
